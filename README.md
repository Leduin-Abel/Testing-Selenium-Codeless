My introduction to selenium

## First Steps

This the Selenium IDE, after running a test, as one can see the test was successful

The log of each command and the result of each command

The reference of each command explaining what each one entails

Those are user inserted commands which the IDE allows, one can read the reference tab for a short explanation or search the documentation for a longer one

Using curly braces in this manner allows a test  different from the one the one in which the store command was used to access whatever string the store command has saved, this is called interpolation

This command allows you to insert JS code into the test as needed

## Special commands

Using conditionals to control the flow of the test

That is the "repeat if" block of code that represents one of the loops which the selenium IDE works with, there is also times: which repeats a set of instructions a given number of times and while which repeats a set instructions meanwhile a condition is met
